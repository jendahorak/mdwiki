|ge:MappedFeature|Mapped Feature|-- Definition --
  A spatial representation of a GeologicFeature.
  
  -- Description --
  A MappedFeature is part of a geological interpretation. 
  It provides a link between a notional feature (description package) and one spatial representation of it, or part of it (exposures, surface traces and intercepts, etc) which forms the specific bounded occurrence, such as an outcrop or map polygon.|
