|cp-ext:CadastralBoundary|Extended cadastral parcel boundaries|The extension targets on providing full cadastral map as defined in Cadastral Public Note in the form of vectror data in the structure fully conform to the INSPIRE Directive and Implementing Rules. The data extends the INSPIRE Data Specification for the theme Cadastral Parcels (CP) for easements, geodetic points, other features, original geometry and analogue cadastral parcels (those in the areas with analogue map only). It originates in the cadastral map that is a binding national map series at large scale, contains points of horizontal geodetic control, planimetric component and map lettering and can be maintained in the form of digital map, analogue map or digitized map. The data published in the frame of this product contain cadastral districts (for the whole Czech Republic), parcels, their boundaries, easements, other features, geodetic points and original geometries from the territory where the digital map occures (to the 2024-04-29 it is 99.03% of the Czech territory, i.e. 78 098.22km2) and analogue cadastral parcels in the areas with analogue map, containing only reference points as geometry.
